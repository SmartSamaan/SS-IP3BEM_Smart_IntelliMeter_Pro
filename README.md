Smart IntelliMeter Pro: WiFi Based Three-Phase Bidirectional Energy Metering Evaluation/Development Board
Smart IntelliMeter Pro SS-IP3BEM is an industrial grade WiFi MCU based 3-phase bidirectional energy metering development/evaluation board with an onboard ESP32-WROOM-32UE WiFi/Bluetooth controller incorporating a RS-485 communication port. The board has the capability to interface with a character LCD (16x2, 20x2, 16x4, or 20x4) in 4-bit mode as well as a serial I2C display. The on-chip flash memory of the controller is used to store the energy variables as well as calibration constants. The main features of the board are:
•	ESP32-WROOM-32UE controller 4MB Flash, 448kB ROM, 536kB SRAM
•	WiFi protocol: 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth v4.2 +EDR, Class 1, 2 and 3
•	USB Type-C port for serial communication between the board and PC to access measurement data on the PC as well as programming of the MCU.
•	I2C port for serial interfacing of OLED displays (e.g., 0.96" or 1.3" OLED display or similar)
•	4-bit interface for character LCDs (e.g., 16x2, 20x2, 16x4, 20x4 or similar)
•	A JTAG interface for programming of the MCU using ESP-IDF
•	Two pushbuttons for custom navigation of LCD display windows
•	RS-485 communication port for industrial grade communication with other devices
